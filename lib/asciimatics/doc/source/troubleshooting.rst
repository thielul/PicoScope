Troubleshooting
===============

Installation issues
-------------------

Android
^^^^^^^

To run on Android, you need access to a CLI environment.  I've found that https://termux.com does
the trick, but you need to install some extra packages before you can install asciimatics.

After installing termux, start up the app and run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt update
    apt-get install clang python-dev libjpeg-dev
    LDFLAGS=-L/system/lib pip install Pillow
    pip install asciimatics

Linux
^^^^^
Although asciimatics is a pure python implementation, it depends on Pillow (a fork of the Python
Imaging Library).  This package depends on some native libraries that must be installed first.
For details of what libararies you need, see `the Pillow documentation
<http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#external-libraries>`__.

For a list of possible solutions, see the `answer on Stackoverflow
<http://stackoverflow.com/q/24646305/4994021>`__.  In short, either install the native libraries
you need, or force an installation of an older version (2.9.0) of Pillow.

256 colours not working
-----------------------
By default a lot of terminals will only support 8/16 colours.  Windows users are limited to just
these options for a native Windows console.  However other systems can enable extra colours by
picking a terminal that supports the extended colour palettes.  For details of which terminals
support additional colours and how to enable them see `this Wikipedia article
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_terminal_emulators>`_.

In most cases, simply selecting a terminal type of ``xterm-256color`` will usually do the trick
these days.

.. _mouse-issues-ref:

Mouse support not working
-------------------------
Curses systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Mouse support isn't fully enabled by default on all terminal types.  This will often require some
extra extensions to be enabled as described `here
<http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/35021/how-to-configure-the-terminal
-so-that-a-mouse-click-will-move-the-cursor-to-the>`__.  In addition, if you want 256 colours, you
will need to mix modes as described `here
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29020638/which-term-to-use-to-have-both
-256-colors-and-mouse-move-events-in-python-curse>`__.

Although it is possible to get Linux terminals to report all mouse movement, the reporting of mouse
buttons along with movement appears to be highly erratic.  The best reporting appears to be using
the button event mode - i.e. mixing ``xterm-1002`` with ``xterm-256color``.

Windows
^^^^^^^
Asciimatics will reprogram the Windows console to report mouse events on start-up.  However, it is
possible to change this while the application is running.  In particular, if you switch on
QuickEdit mode, Windows will stop reporting mouse events and process them itself.  It is not
possible to have both, so if you want to use the mouse in yor app, please switch off QuickEdit
mode.

Windows title does not change
-----------------------------
Much like mouse support, the commands to set the window title is not supported on all terminal
types.  Windows should work without any changes.  Other systems may need to use a similar method
as above to mix modes to add status line support as described `here
<https://gist.github.com/KevinGoodsell/744284>`_.

.. _ctrl-s-issues-ref:

Ctrl+S does not work
--------------------
In order to maintain legacy support for real terminal systems, most terminals/consoles still
support software flow control using Ctrl+S/Ctrl+Q. You can switch this off on Linux by typing
``stty -ixon`` in your shell before you start asciimatics as explained `here
<http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/12107/
how-to-unfreeze-after-accidentally-pressing-ctrl-s-in-a-terminal>`__. Sadly, there is nothing that
can be done on Windows to prevent this as it is built in to the operating system, so you will never
be able to detect the Ctrl+S key.  See `here
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26436581/is-it-possible-to-disable-system-
console-xoff-xon-flow-control-processing-in-my>`__ for details.

Backspace or delete are not working
-----------------------------------
Some users have reported this on curses systems.  So far this has been tracked down to issues with
the terminal configuration.  For an in-depth explanation of the problem and several possible
solutions see `here <http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard.html>`__.

This seems to be particularly problematic for Mac OS X users, where the default terminal app as
shipped with the OS doesn't match the terminfo definitions.  Genius!  If you're on OSX, running
the following inside your terminal *should* fix up the mismatch.

.. code-block:: bash

    infocmp "$TERM" | sed -Ee 's/(kbs)=[^,]*/\1=\\177/' -e 's/(kdch1)=[^,]*/\1=\\E[3~/' > "$TERM"
    tic "$TERM"
    rm -f "$TERM"

I can't run it inside PyCharm or other IDEs
-------------------------------------------
Depending on which version you're using, you may see pywintypes.error 6 (ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE), or
simply nothing (i.e. it looks like the program has hung).  The reason for this is that the IDE
Terminal/Console is not a true native terminal/console and so the native interfaces used by
asciimatics will not work.  There are 2 workarounds.

1. The simplest is just to run asciimatics inside a real terminal or window - i.e. not inside
   PyCharm/the IDE.

2. If you must run inside PyCharm, the only option I've got working so far is the tests but even
   some of them need to skip where they cannot actually run.  To run from the IDE, you must start a
   real console from the Terminal window e.g. using `start cmd /c "python <your file name>"`.

.. _unicode-issues-ref:

Unicode characters are not working
----------------------------------
Curses systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Most modern versions of Linux/OSX come with a good selection of glyphs supported as standard.  The
most likely issue is that you are not using a UTF-8 locale.

To set this up, follow the instructions `here <http://stackoverflow.com/q/7165108/4994021>`__ for
OSX or `here <http://serverfault.com/q/275403>`__ for Linux.

If that doesn't solve the problem and you are seeing unexpected lines in your block drawing
characters, you are using a Terminal with extra spacing between your lines.

OSX allows you to edit the spacing as explained `here <http://superuser.com/
questions/350821/how-can-i-change-the-line-height-in-terminal-osx>`__, but Linux users will
probably need to install a different terminal as explained `here
<http://askubuntu.com/questions/194264/how-do-i-change-the-line-spacing-in-terminal>`__.  I have
found that `rxvt-unicode-256color` is most likely to work.

Windows
^^^^^^^
On Windows systems, there are a couple of potential issues.  The first is that you might be using
the wrong code page.  Windows comes with `many <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/
desktop/dd317756(v=vs.85).asp>`__ code pages.  By default, asciimatics will only enable unicode
features if you are using code page 65001 (the UTF-8 code page).  You can fix this issue by
running::

    chcp 65001

If this does not solve the issue, the next possibility is that you may be using the Lucida Console
or Consolas fonts.  These do not have a full enough range of glyphs to support all the unicode
output that asciimatics can generate.

To fix this issue, you need to download a font with a wider range of glyphs and then install them
as the default for your command prompt.  Details of how to do that are available `here <http://
www.techrepublic.com/blog/windows-and-office/quick-tip-add-fonts-to-the-command-prompt/>`__.
I recommend that you use the `DejaVu Mono font <http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page>`__, which
you can extract from the ZIP file from the `download page
<http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Download>`__ - it is DejaVuSansMono.ttf in the TTF folder of the ZIP.

Redirecting STDIN
-----------------
Generally speaking, it is not recommended that you try to do this as it will prevent asciimatics
from being able to read the terminal input.  However, if you must do this, `this question
<http://stackoverflow.com/q/3999114/4994021>`__ on StackOverflow should give you some help on how
to reconnect terminal input on curses based systems.
